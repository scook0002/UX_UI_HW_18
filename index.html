                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>My approach to User Research is to always remain curious and to not enter the research with assumptions.</p>
                    <p>Remaining open and curious allows me to absorb user insights like a sponge, that I can then use to guide my design process.</p>
                    <p>During User Research, I use Miro, Google Drive, Documents, and Surveys to record and analyze user insights.</p>

                    <h3>User Empathy</h3>
                    <p>My approach to User Empathy is to put the user at the center of attention.</p>
                    <p>When I can solely focus on the user, I can gain a deep understanding of who they are and what is important to them.</p>
                    <p>By empathizing with the user, I am better able to design a digital experience that exceeds their expectations, as well as meets their wants, needs, and desires.</p>

                    <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
                    <p>My approach to Qualitative Interviews is to get into the mind of the user.</p>
                    <p>I want to have a conversation as if I were talking to a friend to gain a deeper connection and deeper insight into what the user actually thinks.</p>
                    <p>During Qualitative Interviews, it is important that I create an Interview Script with questions that are not leading but instead facilitate an open and honest conversation.</p>
